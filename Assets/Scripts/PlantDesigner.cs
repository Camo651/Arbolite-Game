/*
 * If it is grassy, just put a bunch of grass down in a messy fashion
 *
 * if it is a sTree, lTree, foliage, or vine:
 * start the plant at a base anchor node
 * based on its age, more branches can be grown from the previous and expand outwards
 * use vars to control the vertical and horizontal spread of branches
